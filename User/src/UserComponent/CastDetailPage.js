            Best known to play the roles of `Gisele Yashar` in the Fast &
            Furious film series and the superhero character, `Wonder Woman,` Gal
            Gadot is an Israeli actress and model who works in Hollywood films.
            Before venturing into films, the actress was a popular model and
            participated in various beauty pageants. After winning the Miss
            Israeli pageant, she represented Israel at the Miss World beauty
            contest. Some of her most popular films include Fast & Furious
            (2009), Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of
            Justice (2016), Wonder Woman (2017) and Wonder Woman 1984 (2020).
            EARLY LIFE Born in Rosh HaAyin, Israel, Gadot is the daughter of
            Irit Weiss and Micahel Gadot. The actress` mother worked as a
            teacher, whilst her father was an engineer. The actress, who has a
            Polish-Jewish, Austrian-Jewish, and Czech-Jewish lineage, hails from
            a family where her grandparents were Holocaust survivors. Gadot`s
            parents Hebraized their surname from Greenstein to Gadot. The
            actress completed her high school with a major in biology and later
            she studied law at The Reichman. While she was at school, owing to
            her tall frame, she played on the school basketball team. When she
            was 18, the beautiful actress aspired to be a fashion model and she
            participated in several beauty pageants. In 2004, Gadot won the Miss
            Israel competition and she later, in the year, competed in the Miss
            Universe pageant in Ecuador. After her tryst with modeling, when she
            turned 20, she joined the Israeli Army as it is mandatory to serve
            in the military for every Israeli citizen. The actress served in the
            army for two years as an enlisted soldier and she excelled through
            the three-month grueling boot camp. Speaking of her time in the
            army, Gadot said, "You give two or three years, and it is not about
            you. You give your freedom away for a while. You learn discipline
            and respect. The things I have been through as a soldier prepared me
            to deal with career things as well." After completing her military
            services, the actress went to study law but she dropped out of
            college in the first year as a casting director called her to
            audition for the role Bond girl, Camile Montes in the Quantum of
            Solace. However, the actress lost the role to Olga Kurylenko and the
            same casting director later hired Gadot to play the role of Gisele
            in Fast & Furious.
